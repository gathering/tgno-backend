# TG.no - Backend

**NB** Public repo. So avoid pushing secrets...

CMS and REST API built using [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/). It runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default. With admin pages exposed on [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) and API exposed at [http://localhost:8000/api/v2/](http://localhost:8000/api/v2/)

For actual production usage we will most likely rely entierly on [REST API](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/api/v2/configuration.html), so consider all templates and html views test/dev only.

Initial site following structure as outlined in official [Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). So check that out for a quick introduction into how contents are structured.

## Current state

- Following Wagtail getting started tutorial
- `aktuelt` app is combination of `blog` from tutorial and start of actual Aktuelt section
- REST API requirements in place and certain routes exposed via `api.py` files (mapped in `tgno/urls.py`)
- `home` and `search` apps are init/tutorial leftovers

Example urls
- [Aktuelt / News API](http://localhost:8000/api/v2/news/)
- [Aktuelt section / news page](http://localhost:8000/aktuelt/)

**Prioritized tasks:**

- [x] Get local `docker-compose` based development setup functional and documented
- [x] Get local editor tooling functional and documented
- [ ] Get staging environment up and running using terraform (in another repo for now)
- [x] Limit sub-page types available on `aktuelt` app
- [ ] Start iterating on `aktuelt` app to get a minimal realistic and functional article setup in place  (look at existing page for inspiration)
- [ ] Iterate on README and other docs to include any relevant commands and setup steps

## Getting started

### 1. Get things up and running locally

We are using Docker via docker-compose for local development. To get started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Start apps via `docker-compose up`
3. Wait until apps are running, and calmed down
4. Create admin user via `make createsuperuser`

Once running you should start an interactive shell in `web` container in order to have full access to any Django and Wagtail commands. This can be done via `docker-compose exec web bash`, or via our shortcut `make`/`make shell`

We recommend this approach since it makes it a lot easier to tinker and learn how things work. To list all commands available try `python manage.py` (while in the interactive shell)

And no, we will not try to replicate every possible command in our Makefile.

### 2. Make sure you are ready to commit code

We use pre-commit for making sure all code conforms to the same formatting. This happens automatically on commit after this first time setup.

1. Install [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) (Usually `pip install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`)
2. Activate it via `pre-commit install`

## Production setup

Site should follow expected Wagtail and Django patterns if nothing else is mentioned.

### Things to keep in mind

- We allow for scheduled content, make sure to run `publish_scheduled` command every x minutes

## Tests

Use `python manage.py test` in container, or `make test` locally to run test suite. We generally try to rely on Wagtail and Djange framework as much as possible, but feel free to test custom behaviour/code and add sanity checks.

Having test coverage will be helpful when debugging issues or figuring out how existing code was intended to behave (aka. answering the age old question of, is current behaviour a bug or just an unknown feature?).

## Contribute?

This repo is developed and maintained by the [Systemst√∏tte crew](https://wannabe.gathering.org/tg24/crew#crew-82) at [The Gathering](https://www.gathering.org). Once we get further along PR will be accepted, for now either apply to join our crew or reach out to us via issues before spending any time on development.
